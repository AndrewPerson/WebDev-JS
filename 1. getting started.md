# Why do we need Javascript?

Javascript allows us to add *interactivity* to websites. Javascript is *part* of what makes websites more than just static documents. That said, you shouldn't use javascript for *everything*. If there's a way to do something in CSS or HTML (in a non-hacky way), do it that way!

# How do we use Javascript?

We use javascript by embedding scripts in HTML pages.

Here's an example:

```html
<script>
    console.log("Hello world!");
</script>
```

We can also have links to files:

```html
<script src="path/to/some/file.js"></script>
```
