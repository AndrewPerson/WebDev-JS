# Functions

Functions allow us to reuse bits of code. Absolutely *everything* you write will use functions.

We *define* functions to take a set of inputs and run some code that uses those inputs. That code can then *return* a value, but it doesn't have to.

We can then *call* functions to run that code.

Here's an example:

```js
console.log("Hello world!");
```

This is one way of displaying things in JS. Here, `console` is an object, and `log` is a `field` on it that is a function. Functions can be used just like any other data type, they even have their own `fields`!

In the example above, we *call* `console.log` with the input `"Hello world!"`

`console.log` then runs some code and displays `"Hello world!"`

The `console.log` function doesn't return anything.

Let's see how we *define* functions now.

```js
function addOne(num) {
    return num + 1;
}
```

This function does what it says. You call it with a number as an input, it adds 1 to it, then it *returns* it.

Here's an example using it:

```js
console.log(addOne(1)); // Logs 2
```

When the code is run, `addOne` returns 2, which is then passed into `console.log`.

We can also store the results of functions as variables.

```js
let onePlusOne = addOne(1);
```

`onePlusOne` would be equal to 2.
