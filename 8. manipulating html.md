# Manipulating HTML

This is where the fun starts!

Say we have this piece of HTML:

```html
<p id="greeting">Hello!</p>
```

And we want to change the text to *"Hello World!"*

We can access HTML elements in JS by calling `document.getElemenyById` and passing in the id of the element we want to get.

So our javascript to get the element would look like this:

```js
let greeting = document.getElementById("greeting");
```

We can get and set the text of an element by using the `innerText` property.

```js
let greeting = document.getElementById("greeting");

greeting.innerText = "Hello world!";
```
