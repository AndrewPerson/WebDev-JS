# Setting up an advanced development environment

Up until now, we've just been using VS Code for editing simple files. However, for more complex projects, there are a number of tools that can be used to help you with the development process.

This will walk you through setting up some of these tools.

## Installing NodeJS

1. Head to the [NodeJS website](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. Click the `Download` button for the LTS release.
3. Run the downloaded file to install NodeJS.

### What is NodeJS?

Put simply, NodeJS allows you to run Javascript outside of a browser. This is handy for web-developers as the primary programming language we'll deal with is Javascript, and it's handy to be able to use the same language everywhere.

NodeJS also comes with NPM (the Node Package Manager). This is allows you to install packages, small (or sometimes large) bits of code that you can use in your projects.

What are some uses of NodeJS?

1. Using Javascript frameworks. Writing plain HTML is slow and tedious. Frameworks help simplify or automate the more complex parts of making a website.
2. Using Javascript build tools. Build tools allow you to automatically process your code, letting the computer do certain things for you, such as optimising it.
3. Using Javascript libraries. Libraries are useful for providing common functionality that you can use in your projects.
4. Using Javascript testing tools. Testing tools allow you to test your code, and make sure it works as you expect.

## Installing Git

1. Head to the [Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2. Click the download link for your OS.
3. Run the downloaded file to install Git.

### What is Git?

Git is a version control system. This allows you to keep a history of all the changes in your projects. This history then enables multiple people to collaborate on a project, or to revert to previous versions of the code.

## Setting up Github

1. Head to the [Github website](https://github.com).
2. Click the `Sign up` button.
3. Follow the instructions to create a new account.
4. Head to the `Settings` page.
5. Head to the [`Emails`](https://github.com/settings/emails) page.
6. Add your school email address to your list of emails.

### What is Github?

Github is a web-based repository hosting service. It's primary role is to store and share code, which it does using Git. However, it also provides many other features, such as a code review system, a bug tracking system, and a wiki.
