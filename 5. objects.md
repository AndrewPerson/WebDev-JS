# Objects

Objects are an advanced data type, and one that you will nearly always use in JavaScript.

An object can be thought of as a "dictionary" of other data types.

This means that we can access data stored in it using *names*.

Here's an example of a variable storing an object:
```js
let nameInfo = {
    name: "Andrew",
    initials: "AP"
}
```

*I've left out the semicolon for purely aesthetical reasons.*

Each part of an object is made up of `key: value` declarations.

If we wanted to get the`name` part of the object, we would write `nameInfo.name;`

If we wanted to get the `initials` part of the object, we would write `nameInfo.initials;`

If we wanted to set the `name` part of the object, we would write `nameInfo.name = "Some Name";`

This also applies for other types of data as well. For example, if you wanted to get the length of a string, you would use `"some string".length;`

Objects are a powerful way of structuring data, and you'll use them a lot.
