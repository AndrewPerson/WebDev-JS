# Basics

This is an explanation of how programs in general work, without any code.

Code is stored as text, in a file.

Computers read the file line-by-line in order to tell them what to do.

We can store data in *"variables"*. Variables can be reused elsewhere in a program so we can use the same piece of data multiple times.

The order in which a computer reads the code is called the *"flow"*. Sometimes, we need to control the flow.

An example would be if we want to run different code based on whether this is the first time the user has run our program. In this case, we would want the computer to *"skip"* a part of the code in some cases, hence, controlling the flow.

Another example is repeating the same thing. We can use *"loops"* to run the same piece of code over and over again by making the computer jump back to the beginning when it reaches the end of the code. Again, flow control.

The idea of flow control will make more sense later on.

We can also run the same *"block"* of code many times using *"functions"*.

This is a bit complex and will be explained later.

*"Syntax"* can be thought of as the *"grammar"* of a coding language. The syntax is what symbols and characters you have to put in certain places to let a computer understand your code.
