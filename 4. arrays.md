# Arrays

As you already know, arrays are like a list of other data types. We create arrays by putting the data we want to store inside `[]`.

```js
let names = ["Andrew", "John", "James"];
```

The `names` variable would be storing the values `"Andrew"`, `"John"`, and `"James"`. You *can* put multiple *types* of data in an array, but it's not recommended. It makes your code really confusing.

Arrays in JavaScript are *"zero-indexed"*. This means that the first item is the at the zeroth position, the second is at the first, and so on.

We can access items in an array if we know what position they're in. Say we wanted to get the first name from our `names` variable from back there. We know that the first item is in position 0. Therefore, we can access it by writing `names[0];` If we want to access the second item, we can use `names[1];` And so on.

The concept of being zero-indexed may seem a bit pointless and confusing, but it's actually very important.

*Note: It's actually called the "index" of the item, not it's position.*
