# Flow Control

Earlier, you were told that you could alter the "flow" of a program: Here's how.

## `If` Statements

Say we wanted to do something if the user had run our program for the first time. Our code might look like this:

```js
if (firstTime) {
    // ...Do stuff if firstTime is true
}

//...Rest of the program
```

The `if` allows us to choose whether or not to run the code in the `{}` that follow afterwards.

The value inside the `()` should be a `boolean`. If it's `true`, then the code inside the `{}` will run, otherwise, it won't.

There are also `else` statements, which run code if an `if` statement *doesn't* run.

```js
if (firstTime) {
    // ...Do stuff if firstTime is true
}
else {
    // ...Do stuff if firstTime is false
}

//...Rest of the program
```

Finally, there are also `else if` statements, which are just an `if` statement that runs if *another* `if` statement doesn't.

```js
if (firstTime) {
    // ...Do stuff if firstTime is true
}
else if (secondTime) {
    // ...Do stuff if firstTime is false
    // and secondTime is true
}
else {
    // ...Do stuff if firstTime and
    // secondTime are false
}

//...Rest of the program
```

## `For` Loop

The `for` loop can do 2 things in JavaScript.

The first is that we can iterate over all the items in an array and run a piece of code for each item.

The second is that we can iterate over a sequence of numbers. This doesn't sound to useful, but it is.

Here's an example of the first kind of `for` loop:

```js
let names = ["Andrew", "John", "James"];

for (let name of names) {
    // ...Do stuff with the name.
}
```

Whatever code is inside the `{}` will be run for each item inside the `names` variable. We can access that item by using the `name` variable.

Here's an example of the second kind of `for` loop:

```js
let names = ["Andrew", "John", "James"];

for (let i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
    let name = names[i];
    // ...Do stuff with i and name.
}
```

This loop has a *lot* more things going on in it.

Let's start with the code inside the `()` (`let i = 0; i < names.length; i++`)

This is actually comprised of 3 statements.

The first one is the *"initialisation"* statement. This is a *single* *"line"* of code that is run *before* the `for` loop starts.

The second statement is the *"condition"*. This is a line of code that produces a `true` or `false` value. This one is checking whether `i` is *less than* the length of `names`. As long as this statement is true, the `for` loop will keep going.

The third statement runs at then end of each iteration of the `for` loop. In this case, it increases `i` by 1.

You'll probably have noticed that this `for` loop does the same thing as the first one, but in a much longer way. The reason why we use this second type of `for` loop at all is that sometimes, we need to know the *index* of each item, as well as the item itself. In this second `for` loop, we can see that the index is `i`.

## While Loops

`While` loops generally aren't used as much as `for` loops.

Here's an example `while` loop:

```js
let names = ["Andrew", "John", "James"];

let i = 0;
while (i < names.length) {
    let name = names[i];

    // ...Do stuff with i and name

    i++;
}
```

And you thought that the `for` loop was confusing.

Inside the `()` in the `while` loop is a single statement. This the *"condition"*. Much like the condition in a `for` loop, it provides either a `true` or `false` value. As long as the value is `true`, the `while` loop will keep running.

The `while` loop generally isn't used like I've shown you. (Looping over a list.) A (good) use case for a `while` loop might be in a guessing game, where you keep running the same code (asking the user a question) until they get the right answer.
